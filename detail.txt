Temp sensor working properly
Acc sensor working properly
Advertising logic is working properly (152 packets two for battery and temperature 150 for accelerometer)
pin high low logic working properly
button login is working properly but now system will be in sleep mode unless button is pressed not in power off mode.

Some findings:-
1. we have done 3 changes in advertising.c file to configure the sensornode in non-connectable and non-scannable mode
on line no 321,504,592. Along with that functions  gap_params_init();  gatt_init();  conn_params_init(); are commented
in main function.
2. For sending only one packet we have added this "p_advertising->adv_params.max_adv_evts=1;" in advertising.c file
on line 593 and 508. on doing so even by changing APP_ADV_DURATION every time 3packets are being advertised, checked 
it on wireshark as in one advertising event packet is sent on 3 channels.
